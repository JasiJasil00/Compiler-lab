🧪 Experimental Compiler – Stage 0
This repository contains Stage-0 of my implementation of an experimental compiler, created as part of the Compiler Design Lab during my 6th semester at NIT Calicut.

The project is based on the EXPL language and the official eXpOS documentation.

✅ Stage 0 Progress
✔️ Installation setup

✔️ Code generation for arithmetic expressions

✔️ Introduction to static storage allocation

This stage lays the foundation for the compiler by handling simple arithmetic expressions and memory management using static allocation.
